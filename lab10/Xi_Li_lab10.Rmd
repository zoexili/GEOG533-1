## Question 1
Use R package UScensus2010county to complete the following tasks:  (20 pt.)

### Question 1(a)
Plot a map of New York counties using the plot function.
```{r}
library(UScensus2010county)
data("new_york.county10")
shp <- new_york.county10
plot(shp)
```

### Question 1(b)	
Plot a map of New York counties using the qtm function.
```{r}
library(tmap)
qtm(shp,fill = "NAME10")
```


### Question 1(c)	
How many counties in New York State?
```{r}
length(shp)
```

### Question 1(d)	
What’s the 3-digit fips code of Broome County?
```{r}
# RMD won't KNIT so i have to comment them out!
#data(countyfips)
#countyfips[countyfips$countyname=="broome county",] #007
```

### Question 1(e)	
Compute descriptive statistics of the population column (P0010001), including total, minimum, maximum, mean, median, and skewness. 
```{r}
summary(shp$P0010001)
sum(shp$P0010001)
library(moments)
skewness(shp$P0010001)
```

### Question 1(f)	
Create a histogram and a boxplot of the population.
```{r}
hist(shp$P0010001,main="New York State Population by Counties")
boxplot(shp$P0010001,main="New York State Population by Counties")
```


## Question 2
Use R package UScensus2010tract to complete the following tasks:    (20 pt.)
```{r}
#install.packages("UScensus2010tract", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```

### Question 2(a)	
Plot a map of New York census tracts using the plot function.
```{r}
library(UScensus2010tract)
data("new_york.tract10")
tract <- new_york.tract10
plot(tract)
```

### Question 2(b)
Compute the total population based on census tracts.
```{r}
df <- tract@data
sum(df$P0010001)
```

### Question 2(c)
Select all census tracts in Broome County and plot the map. 
```{r}
library(UScensus2010)
broome <- county(fips="007",name="broome",state="ny",level="tract")
plot(broome)
```

### Question 2(d)
What’s the total population of Broome County?
```{r}
View(broome)
broome.sum <- sum(broome$P0010001)
```

### Question 2(e)
Create a histogram and a boxplot of population based on census tracts of Broome County.
```{r}
hist(broome$P0010001,main="Broome County Population by Census Tract")
boxplot(broome$P0010001,main="Broome County Population by Census Tract")
```

### Question 2(f)
Select the first five columns of the shapefile of Broome County census tract; add a new population ratio column (= census tract population / county population); save the new shapefile to the hard drive. 
```{r}
broome.f <- broome[,1:5]
View(broome.f)
broome.f$popRatio <- broome.f$P0010001/broome.sum
library(rgdal)
writeOGR(broome.f,dsn="output",layer="broome.f",driver="ESRI Shapefile",overwrite_layer = TRUE)
readOGR(dsn = "output", layer = "broome.f")
```


## Question 3

Use R packages raster and ncdf4 to complete the following tasks:     (20 pt.)
```{r}
library(raster)
library(ncdf4)
```

### Question 3(a)		
Load the multi-band raster dataset “NDVI.nc” into R.
```{r}
ras <- brick("NDVI.nc")
ras
```

### Question 3(b)		
Get the basic information about the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, cells, and bands; spatial resolution, extent, bounding box, and projection.
```{r}
nrow(ras)
ncol(ras)
ncell(ras)
nlayers(ras)
res(ras)
extent(ras)
bbox(ras)
projection(ras)
```

### Question 3(c)	
Aggregate all bands to generate a mean NDVI raster and a maximum NDVI raster; save the two new raster datasets to the hard drive. 
```{r}
mean(ras)
writeRaster(mean(ras),filename = "mean_ras.tif")
max(ras)
writeRaster(max(ras),filename = "max_ras.tif")
```

### Question 3(d)			
Plot the maps of monthly NDVI of the year 2001
```{r}
plot(ras[[1:12]])
```

### Question 3(e)	
Create histograms of monthly NDVI of the year 2001.
```{r}
hist(ras[[1:12]])
```

### Question 3(f)			
Plot the NDVI map of July 2000; click any location with data on the map and retrieve the NDVI time series for all years; plot the NDVI time series of the selected location. 
```{r}
plot(ras,7)
#values <- click(ndvi.rb, n=1, xy=FALSE)
values <- ras[60,60]
plot((as.vector(values)), type="b")
```

## Question 1
This is Exercise 1 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem 1a
Find the correlation coefficient, *r*, for the following sample data on income and education:
```{r}
library(knitr)
obs <- seq(1:5)
income <- c(30,28,52,40,35)
edu <- c(12,13,18,16,17)
df <- data.frame(obs,income,edu)
names(df) <- c("Observation","Income ($*1000)","Education (Years)")
kable(df)
```

Solution 1a
```{r}
cor(df,use = "complete.obs",method = "pearson")
```


### Problem 1b
Test the null hypothesis ρ = 0.

Solution 1b
```{r}
result <- cor.test(df$`Income ($*1000)`,df$`Education (Years)`,method = "pearson")
if(result$p.value<=0.05){
  print("we reject the null hypothesis")
} else{
  print("we cannot reject the null hypothesis")
}
```


### Problem 1c
Find Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for these data.

Solution 1c
```{r}
cor(df,use = "complete.obs",method = "spearman")
```


### Problem 1d
Test whether the observed value of rs from part (c) is significantly different from zero.

Solution 1d
```{r}
new_result <- cor.test(df$`Income ($*1000)`,df$`Education (Years)`,method = "spearman")
if(result$p.value<=0.05){
  print("we reject the null hypothesis")
} else{
  print("we cannot reject the null hypothesis")
}
```



## Question 2
This is Exercise 3 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem
The distribution of the t-statistic for testing the significance of a correlation coefficient has n – 2 degrees of freedom. If the sample size is 36 and α = 0.05, what is the smallest absolute value a correlation coefficient must have to be significant? What if the sample size is 80?

### Solution
```{r}
### sample size =36
2/sqrt(36)
### sample size = 80
2/sqrt(80)
```

Y <- c(6,6,10,4)
df <- data.frame(Obs,X,Y)
kable(df)
```

### Solution
```{r}
cor(df,use="complete.obs",method="pearson")
```


## Question 4
This is Exercise 6 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem
Find the correlation coefficient between median annual income in the United States and the number of horse races won by the leading jockey, for the period 1984–1995. Test the hypothesis that the true correlation coefficient is equal to zero. Interpret your results.

```{r}
year <- 1984:1994
income <- c(35165,35778,37027,37256,37512,37997,37343,36054,35593,35241,35486)
races <- c(399,469,429,450,474,598,364,430,433,410,317)
df <- data.frame(year,income,races)
names(df) <- c("Year","Median income","Number of races won by leading jockey")
kable(df)
```


### Solution
```{r}
cor(df,use="complete.obs",method = "pearson")
result <- cor.test(df$`Median income`,df$`Number of races won by leading jockey`,method = "pearson")
if (result$p.value<= 0.05){
  print("we reject the null hypothesis")
}else{
  print("we cannot reject the null hypothesis")
}
```



## Question 5
This is Exercise 7 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem
For the following ranked data, find Spearman’s r, and then test the null hypothesis (using a Type I error probability of 0.10) that the true correlation is equal to zero.

```{r}
library(knitr)
obs <- 1:6
x <- c(1,2,5,6,11,12)
y <- c(8,4,12,3,10,7)
df <- data.frame(obs,x,y)
names(df) <- c("Observation","Rank of x","Rank of y")
kable(df)
```


### Solution
```{r}
cor(df,use = 'complete.obs',method = "spearman")
result <- cor.test(df$`Rank of x`,df$`Rank of y`,method = "spearman")
if (result$p.value<=0.1){
  print("we reject the null hypothesis")
} else{
  print("we cannot reject the null hypothesis")
}
```



## Question 6
This is Exercise 8 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem
Find Pearson’s r for the following data, and then test the null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient is equal to zero. Use a Type I error probability of 0.05.

```{r}
library(knitr)
obs <- 1:6
x <- c(3.2,2.4,1.6,8.3,7.2,5.1)
y <- c(6.2,7.3,8.1,2.6,6.3,4.3)
df <- data.frame(obs,x,y)
names(df) <- c("Observation","x","y")
kable(df)
```


### Solution

### Solution
```{r}
df <- read.csv("UK_Housing.csv")
result <- cor.test(df$floorarea,df$bedrooms,method='pearson')
if (result$p.value<=0.05){
  print('we reject the null hypothesis')
} else{
  print('we cannot reject the null hypothesis')

Solution 9d
```{r}
result <- cor.test(df$speed,df$dist,method="pearson")
### the result from cor.test is the same as the result from part c.

result
# same result as part d
if (result$p.value<= 0.05){

}else{

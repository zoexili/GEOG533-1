Complete the following exercises in Chapter 8 (Introduction to Regression Analysis) of the textbook [R] pages 247-250. 

## Question 1

This is Exercise 1 in Chapter 8 of the Textbook [R].

A regression of weekly shopping trip frequency on annual income (data entered in thousands of dollars) is performed on data collected from 24 respondents. The results are summarized below:

* Intercept: 0.46
* Slope: 0.19

|          | Sum of squares  | Degrees of freedom |  Mean square   |       *F*       |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------|
|Regression|                 |                    |                |                 |
| Residual |       1.7       |                    |                |                 |
| Total    |       2.3       |                    |                |                 |


### Question 1(a)
Fill in the blanks in the ANOVA table.

```{r}
n <- 24

```


|          | Sum of squares  | Degrees of freedom |  Mean square   |       *F*       |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------|
|Regression|       0.6       |       1            |  0.6/1         |0.6/(1.7/r`n-2`) |
| Residual |       1.7       |     r`n-2`         |   1.7/r`n-2`   |                 |
| Total    |       2.3       |     r`n-1`         |                |                 |


### Question 1(b)
What is the predicted number of weekly shopping trips for someone making $50,000/year?
```{r}
pred <- 0.46 + 0.19*50000
pred
```


### Question 1(c)
In words, what is the meaning of the coefficient 0.19?
# For every increase in annual income equal to one thousand dollars, the predicted weekly shopping trip frequency for each respondant will rise by 0.19.


### Question 1(d)
Is the regression coefficient significantly different from zero? How do you know?
```{r}
crit_F <- qf(0.95,df1=1,df2=22)
F_value <- 0.6/(1.7/22) 
if (F_value>crit_F){
  print("The regression coefficient is significantly different from 0")
}else{
  print("The regression coefficient is not significantly different from 0")
}
```



### Question 1(e)
What is the value of the correlation coefficient?
```{r}
r_squared <- 0.6/2.3
r_squared
```





## Question 2

This is Exercise 6 in Chapter 8 of the Textbook [R].

The following data are collected in an effort to determine whether snowfall is dependent upon elevation: 

| Snowfall (inches) | Elevation (feet) |
|-------------------|------------------|
|       36          |       400        |
|       78          |       800        |
|       11          |       200        |
|       45          |       675        |

Using R, show your work on exercises (a) through (g).

### Question 2(a)
Find the regression coefficients (the intercept and the slope coefficient).
```{r}
x <- c(36,78,11,45)
y <- c(400,800,200,675)

result <- summary(m)
result
### intercept: 127.412
### slope coefficient: 9.208
```


### Question 2(b)
Estimate the standard error of the residuals about the regression line.
```{r}
### 109.8 on 2 degrees of freedom
```


### Question 2(c)
Test the hypothesis that the regression coefficient associated with the independent variables is equal to zero. Also place a 95% confidence interval on the regression coefficient.
```{r}
f_crit <- qf(0.95,df1=1,df2=2)
if(result$fstatistic[1]>f_crit){
  print("we reject the null hypothesis")
}else{
  print("we cannot reject the null hypothesis")
}
std.err <- 2.29
q95 <- qnorm(0.95)
conf.95 <- c(9.208-q95*std.err,9.208+q95*std.err) 
conf.95
```


### Question 2(d)
Find the value of $r^2$.
```{r}

adjusted_R_squared <- 0.8349
```


### Question 2(e)
Make a table of the observed values, predicted values, and the residuals.

## Question 3

This is Exercise 10 in Chapter 8 of the Textbook [R].

Use R and the [Milwaukee dataset](http://spatial.binghamton.edu/geog533/data/Milwaukee_Sales.csv) to:

### Problem
perform a regression using sales price as the dependent variable and lot size as the independent variable.

### Solution
```{r}
df <- read.csv("http://spatial.binghamton.edu/geog533/data/Milwaukee_Sales.csv")
X <- df$LotSize
Y <- df$SalePrice
m <- lm(Y~X)

segments(X,fitted(m),X,Y,col='skyblue',lty="dashed")
```



## Question 4

Use R and the Hypothetical [UK Housing Prices dataset](http://spatial.binghamton.edu/geog533/data/UK_Housing.csv) to:

### Question 4(a) 
perform a regression using house price as the dependent variable, and number of bedrooms as the independent variable;

```{r}
url = "http://spatial.binghamton.edu/geog533/data/UK_Housing.csv"
df <- read.csv("http://spatial.binghamton.edu/geog533/data/UK_Housing.csv")
x <- df$bedrooms
y <- df$price

abline(m,col="red",lwd=2)
segments(x,fitted(m),x,y,col='skyblue',lty='dashed')

result <- summary(m)
f_crit <- qf(0.95,df1=1,df2=497)
if(result$fstatistic[1]>f_crit){

} else{
  print("The regression correlation equals to 0")
}
```


## Question 5
Download the [hometown.csv](http://spatial.binghamton.edu/geog533/data/hometown.csv), append your name and hometown coordinates to the csv, then use [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to create a web map (10 pt.)

```{r}

View(df)
de<-data.frame(lastname="Xi", firstname="Li",type="student",location="32.1878,119.4258",latitude = 32.1878,longitude = 119.4258,image="",fullname="Li Xi",popup="")
newdf <- rbind(df, de)
View(newdf)
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng=119.4258,lat=32.1878,popup="Zhenjiang")
```
